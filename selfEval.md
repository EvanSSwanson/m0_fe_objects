# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

Thankfully, this lesson went quite smoothly. I feel confident with the content covered in this lesson.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I tend to slack on my note-taking. To remedy that, I've gotten into the habit of going back over my lessons at the end of the day to make proper notes then. It also serves as a nice "refresher course."

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I'd say both options are ones I employ often; it truthfully depends on the code I'm working on. I typically get as far as I can manage simply experimenting with code first, then go to Google when I've exhausted my options.
